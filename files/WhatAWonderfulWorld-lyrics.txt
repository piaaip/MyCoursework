I see trees of green,
red roses too,
I see them bloom,
for me and you.
And I think to myself:
what a wonderful world!

I see skies of blue
and clouds of white,
the bright blessed day,
the dark sacred night.
And I think to myself:
what a wonderful world!

The colors of the rainbow,
so pretty in the sky,
are also on the faces
of people going by.
I see friends shaking hands,
saying: "How do you do?"
They're really saying:
"I love you!"

I hear babies crying,
I watch them grow,
they'll learn much more
than I'll never know.
And I think to myself:
what a wonderful world!
Yes, I think to myself:
what a wonderful world!
