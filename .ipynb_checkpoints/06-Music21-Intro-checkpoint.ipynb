    "# Welcome to music21!\n",
    "This notebook presents a very brief and short introduction to music21. Therefore, before reading this notebook, watch and try to understand the concepts explained in the video [CMiE'20 - 03: Introducing and installing music21](https://youtu.be/wrREb68FwNM). Especially make sure that:\n",

    "- you have [installed music21](https://youtu.be/wrREb68FwNM?t=4012), and\n",

    "Together with this notebook, you have a new folder called `lsxp-WoBenShi-KongChengJi`. This folder contains three versions of the same score, one with the extension `.mscz`, which is a MuseScore file, a `.pdf` file and a `.xml` file. This score is a transcription of one of the most famous arias of jingju (also known as Peking opera), namely, “我本是卧龙岗散淡的人” (*Wo ben shi Wo Long Gang sandan de ren*, I am an idle man from the Hills of the Crouching Dragon), from the play 《空城计》 (*Kong cheng ji*, The 'empy fort' strategy). Here you have [a recording of this aria performed by Zhang Ke](https://youtu.be/rsg0epYHY6I?t=4484) (from minute 1:14:44 to 1:20:30). You might notice some differences between this recordings and the score. This is normal in jingju, since it is an orally transmitted tradition, and scores are just transcriptions of particular performances. This particular score is taken from the following source:\n",

    "\n",
    "From this printed version, which uses [jianpu notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbered_musical_notation), I created a machine readble score using MuseScore, and then exported it both as `.pdf` and `.xml`. As you might have noticed, the name of the file contains the first three Chinese characters of the aria, `WoBenShi`, and the name of the play, `KongChengJi`. The first four letters `lsxp` indicate, first, the role type that sings the aria, in this case *laosheng* (`ls`), and also the *shengqiang* (or melodic schema) in which the aria is arranged, in this case, *xipi* (`xp`). In fact, this score is taken from a collection of machine readable scores created for the computational study of jingju music, in which all scores are named following this standard.

The fourth element is a metadata object, containing information about the score. We also are not interested in that. The last element is a layout object, containing information (like sizes and distances between the score elements) for visually displaying the score using a score editor or similar software. But we want to work with the music. And that is stored in the fifth and sixth elements. As you can see, they are two streams of the type `part`. They have an instrument assigned to them, `piano`, which is assigned by default (not important). These two parts correspond to the two staves contained in our score, the first one for the instrumental accompaniment, and the second one for the vocal line (you can check it in the `.pdf` version of the score).\n",

    "\n",
    "When you retrive objects from a music21 stream using an attribute such as `.parts` or others, music21 likes you to save them in a variable as a new stream. So, in order to do that, you can just add the method `.stream()` at the end, like this: `s.parts.stream()`. This command retrives only the streams of type `part` from the `score` stream and stores them in a new stream. This stream is not of the type `score`, nor `part` nor `measure`, it is just an artificial stream that contains whichever objects we want to store in it. Since it is a stream, we can also call the `.elements` attribute on it to access the elements contained in this new stream.\n",

    "⇒ **Note**: when creating variables, avoid calling them the same way as functions, methods, attributes or other pre-existent elements in the system. For example, now we are going to retrive the parts from the score and save them in a variable. It seems logical to call that variable `parts`. However, `.parts` is a music21 attribute for scores, so this can create problems. I personally like initials, like `s` for score, `p` for part, `m` for measure, `n` for note and so on. And I double the initial when I create a variable that contains more than one of those items, like `pp` for a stream of parts, `mm` for a stream of measures and so on.

But from index 2 to index 118, all those elements are, as you can see, slur objects. And this is one of the weird issues with music21. All the slurs in the score, are loaded as independent objects separated from the notes they embrace. Even though this is extrange and inconvenient if you want to work with the slurs, it shows that for music21 the essential information of a score are the notes, and the rest is secondary.\n",

    "So, from index 119 on, all the elements are streams of the type `measure`. And this is what we want! Because these measures contain the notes. To retrive only the measures from a part, we can use an interesting method call `.getElementByClass()`. This method retrives all the elements of the class that you give it as input which are contained in the strem on which you call it. So, let's retrive all the measures of the instrumental part and save them in a variable called `mm_instr` (`mm` for 'measures'), and the same for the vocal part. And remember, whenever you retrieve elements from a stream, music21 likes you to save them as a new stream. Finally, let's see if this streams that we created containing only measures are of equal length."
