Python allows creating text files, also using the `open()` function. If when we call it we give as second parameter either `'w'`, for writing, or `'a'` for appending new content, if the file given as first parameter doesn't exist, it will be created. The output of the `open()` function is a handle to the newly created file. To add content to it, the method `.write()` can be used. Finally, we have to close the handle to the new file, by running the method `.close()`.\n",

    "## Working with tables (`csv` files)\n",
    "Text files generally contain what is known as *unstructured* (or also *raw*) data. However, for our computational work, most of the time we will need *structured* data. One of the simplest, and most common ways of structuring data are **tables**. A table consists in a collection of data items, arranged in rows, for which we have different types of information, arranged in columns. But the best way of understanding this is just having a look to an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `files` folder that you downloaded with this notebook, you will also find a `top20movies-RottenTomatoes.csv` file. This file contains information about the first 20 of the [\"Top 100 Movies of All Time\"](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/) according to the website Rotten Tomatoes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first consider the extension, `.csv`. `csv` is the acronym of \"comma separated values,\" and it is the simplest type of tables. As always, before start working with them, \"give a look to your data.\" First, open this file directly in Jupyter by double-clicking on it in the Jupyter Dashboard (or in a text editor, but taking the aforementioned precautions). You'll probably find all the information confusing. But just read the first line. That is the *heading*, and it describes what type of information is stored in each column: `Title`, `Rating`, `Director`, `Year`, etc. These information types are separated by commas, meaning that each of them is in a different column. Then, if you look at the following lines, you will see that each line is a movie, that is, a data item, and for each of them we have the types of information described in the heading, that is, the title of the movie, the rating (according to the users of Rotten Tomatoes), the director of the movie, etc. And in each line, these pieces of information are also separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a more understandable way of looking at this data, which is opening the `top20movies-RottenTomatoes.csv` file with your spreadsheet software, such as Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice Calc, o Google Sheets. (I uploaded it to my Google Drive, so hopefully you can access it through Google Sheets with [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zYA0puYwwMEPIK__lkQAPUaJpHWwdWfKgM82FO38U5c/edit?usp=sharing)). It might happen that you get a pop-up window asking for some details about how to handle the file. If so, make sure that you select commas as separators. So, if you are looking to this file in a spreadsheet software, hopefully the information is clear! When you close the file, make sure you maintain the `.csv` format and didn't do any format changes.\n",
