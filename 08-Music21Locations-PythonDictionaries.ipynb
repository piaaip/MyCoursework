For example, in exercise 2.6 from notebook 7 we could count the aggregated duration of all the pitches of the score. However, that code requires that we know beforehand the pitches contained in a score. And then, we need to create a variable for each of them, check for each note if its pitch corresponds to any of those, etc. The result, is a quite lengthy code. With dictionaries we can do the same task much more efficiently, since we can have a dictionary with the pitch classes of the score as keys, and their aggregated duration as values. To do that, we can create an empty dictionary, then iterate over the notes, if the note's pitch is not among the keys in our dictionary, we create it defining the duration of the note as its value, but if it alreay is among the keys, then we update its value by adding the new duration.\n",

The keys of this dictionary will be the pitch classes that we find in the vocal part. And the value for each key will be another dictionary. This dictionaries assigned to each pitch class will have only two items. The first one will have the key `'notes'` and its value will be the count of notes with the corresponding pitch class. The second one will have the key `'dur'` (for duration) and its value will be the aggretated duration for that pitch class. Therefore, the result of this code has two, let's say, \"levels\" of dictionaries: one general dictionary whose keys are the pitch classes, and then many, let's call it, \"pitch dictionaries\", in the amount of one per pitch class.
